## Python Script to Get SQM Data

The core script is vanilla pySQM (https://github.com/mireianievas/PySQM), I simply modified their great work and make it to suit my need.

I want to run it as a `service` and combine the config file with my `twroLapse` so everything can be integrated easily (hopefully).

I will write a propper documentation soon. Cheers~
